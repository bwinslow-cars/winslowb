## Introduction

This document is an intro to the way I work, my psychological and operational framework. It will be successfull if it aids in building a better working relationship. I'm aware that all of our experiences predicate this moment and determines our leadership and engagement style.

### Bill Winslow

This is my **README.md**. I struggle writing '*I*' and '*me*' as many times as I do in this file. Writing in the first person is uncomfortable as I prefer pronouns like '*us*' and '*we*'. I tend not to use the word '*feel*' and choose words like '*perceive*', '*relative*' and '*reality*' instead. It's kind of quirky but you deserve to know this about me.

### Communication

I respect your time and effort to read my communications. I prefer efficiency and simplicity and choose a declarative style of writing out of this repect. When possible, I limit using words when numbers are more appropriate. When using slack, I'm less formal. I'm aware of the disruptive nature instant messaging and don't expect imediate responsese. I'll use words like '*ping me when you get a sec*'. If there is urgency I'll use the appropriate adjetives.  

### Engagement
I want you to work autonamisly. The R.A.C.I framework can be used as a tool to aid in your autonomy.
