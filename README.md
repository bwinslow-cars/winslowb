### Introduction

This is my README. I struggle writing 'I' and 'me' as many times as I do in this file. Writing in the first person at length is uncomfortable as I prefer pronouns like 'us' and 'we'. I tend not to use the word 'feel'. I prefer words like 'perceive', 'relative' and 'reality' instead. It's kind of quirky but you deserver to know this about me.

I have a couple of different communication styles. When writing, I prefer efficiency and simplicity. When possible, I limit using words when numbers are more appropriate ('a lot', 'large amount', 'a bunch', etc ), When seeking or sharing information, I may choose a declarative style of writing. And when speaking, I'm casual. I use words like 'dude' and 'cool'.   

Use this document as an intro to the way I operate: my mental and operational framework.  This document accomplishes its goal if it helps you become more effective and helps us build a better working relationship.
