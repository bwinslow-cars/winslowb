### Introduction

#### ⚡ Hi ⚡ 

This is my README.md. This document is for direct reports and peers.  I wrote this because I care how we work together, and I want my team to be successful. I acknowledge upfront that I have quirks. I don’t expect others to change their engagement style and work ‘my way’, but instead to show I’m self aware and perhaps make you think about your own style as well.  

Use this document as an intro to the way I operate: my mental and operational framework.  This document accomplishes its goal if it helps you become more effective and helps us build a better working relationship.
